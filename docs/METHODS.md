# METHODS

The actual method behind each number, with the numbers. `PROVENANCE.md` says
*what* every value is and where it came from; this says *how*, and what each
method can and cannot support.

Sections are added as phases land. Anything not listed here is not yet computed,
and `PROVENANCE.md` names the phase that will compute it.

## 1 · The polarimetric ice screen, and why it is empty by construction

**This is the most important result in the project so far, and it is a negative
one.** It is also the answer to "you didn't find any ice", so it is worth stating
precisely.

### 1.1 What this build actually computes

`backend/scripts/process_real_sar_pipeline.py:405-431` calibrates the two
amplitude channels to σ⁰, applies a 5×5 boxcar multi-look, and forms:

```
σ_sc = ½(√lh − √lv)²                 σ_oc = ½(√lh + √lv)²
CPR  = σ_sc / σ_oc                   DOP  = |lh − lv| / (lh + lv)
```

where `lh`, `lv` are the smoothed σ⁰ of the two channels. Both quantities are
built from **the same two numbers**.

### 1.2 The identity

Write `r = lh/lv` and `x = ln r`. Then

```
CPR = ((√lh − √lv)/(√lh + √lv))²  =  ((√r − 1)/(√r + 1))²  =  tanh²(x/4)
DOP = |lh − lv|/(lh + lv)         =  |(r − 1)/(r + 1)|     =  |tanh(x/2)|
```

Both are monotone functions of the **same single variable** `|x|`. They are not
two observables; they are two reparameterisations of one channel ratio. Eliminate
`x`:

```
CPR = tanh²( artanh(DOP) / 2 )
```

CPR is a **strictly increasing** function of DOP. The two quantities carry
**one degree of freedom between them**, not two.

### 1.3 The consequence for the screen

The screening rule is `CPR > cpr_th` **AND** `DOP < dop_th` — one condition
pushing `|x|` up, the other pushing it down, along the same axis. The DOP
condition therefore imposes a hard ceiling on achievable CPR:

```
DOP < 0.13  ⟹  |x| < 2·artanh(0.13) = 0.2614770
            ⟹  CPR < tanh²(0.2614770/4) = 0.0042611
```

**No pixel satisfying `DOP < 0.13` can exhibit `CPR > 0.0042611` — whatever the
terrain, whatever the instrument, whatever the threshold.** The configured
`CPR_THRESHOLD = 1.00` is **235×** that ceiling, so the screen is *logically
empty*, not merely unsatisfied. `CANDIDATE AREA 0.00 km²` is the only
arithmetically possible answer.

### 1.4 Numerical verification

Run on all 2,337,086 measured pixels of the Faustini frame
(`backend/scripts/build_analysis.py`, emitted as `cpr_dop_identity` and asserted
by `emit_provenance.py`):

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `CPR` predicted from `DOP` alone, max\|residual\| | **1.241 × 10⁻⁶** (float32 storage precision) |
| rms residual | 8.025 × 10⁻⁹ |
| Pearson r between predicted and stored CPR | **0.999999999994** |
| Ceiling implied by `DOP < 0.13` | CPR < 0.0042611 |
| Highest CPR observed among pixels with `DOP < 0.13` | **0.0042611** — the ceiling, hit exactly |

The Phase 1 sensitivity sweep brackets the ceiling without having been designed
to. Its grid was built from the measured percentiles, and the transition falls
exactly where the algebra says it must:

| CPR threshold | vs ceiling 0.0042611 | predicted | observed |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.003546 (measured p90) | below | > 0 | **63,481 px** ✓ |
| 0.009258 (measured p99) | above | 0 | **0 px** ✓ |

One more check at the extreme. The frame's maximum CPR is 0.053411, implying
`|x| = 4·artanh(√0.053411) = 0.941439`, so that pixel's DOP must be
`tanh(0.941439/2) = 0.438780`. Its **measured** DOP is **0.438779**.

That pixel is 3.4× *above* the DOP gate. **The brightest "CPR anomaly" in the
swath is necessarily the least depolarised pixel in it.** This also settles the
old `anomaly_classification` defect twice over: pairing the frame's maximum CPR
with its minimum DOP did not merely describe two different pixels — it described
two pixels that *cannot be the same pixel by construction*.

### 1.5 What this does and does not mean

It does **not** mean there is no ice at the lunar south pole, and it is **not**
evidence against ice. It means this measurement cannot address the question, and
it says so in closed form rather than as a caveat.

The defect is not that the amplitude proxy is *small*. It is that it **collapses
two independent physical observables onto one degree of freedom**, which is why
their conjunction is empty. With the true Stokes vector,

```
CPR = (S0 − S3)/(S0 + S3)          DOP = √(S1² + S2² + S3²)/S0
```

are built from **different combinations** of the four Stokes parameters and are
genuinely independent. `high CPR AND low DOP` then selects a real physical
population. Recovering `S3` requires the phase term `2·Im⟨E_H·E_V*⟩`, which
exists only in the complex `sli` products — 2 × 2.17 GB, on disk, not yet
ingested. That is Phase 5b, and this is the reason it is the fix.

### 1.6 The assertion that keeps this honest

`emit_provenance.py` gate 6 fails the build if `candidate_area_km2` is non-zero
while the CPR source is amplitude-only and `CPR_THRESHOLD` exceeds the ceiling.
A non-zero area there is arithmetically impossible, so it can only be a broken
mask, a swapped threshold, or a silently changed CPR source — **never a
discovery**. The distinction is automatic rather than dependent on somebody
remembering the algebra.

### 1.7 Do not retune the threshold

Lowering `CPR_THRESHOLD` below 0.0042611 would make the screen return area
again. That area would be "pixels whose two channels differ by a little", which
is not a CBOE signature and is not evidence of ice. PRD §2 rule 4 stands: if a
threshold is mis-set, print the distribution and say so. The distribution is
printed above.

## 2 · Georeferencing

The frame is south polar stereographic on a sphere of radius 1,737,400 m
(the product's own `A_AXIS_RADIUS`), read from the GeoTIFF GeoKeys of
`ch2_sar_ncxl_20200808t201154198_d_sri_xx_cp_lh_d18.tif`.

```
lat/lon → x,y :  ρ = 2·R·k₀·tan(π/4 + φ/2),  x = ρ·sin(λ),  y = ρ·cos(λ)
x,y → lat/lon :  ρ = √(x² + y²),  φ = 2·atan(ρ/2Rk₀) − π/2,  λ = atan2(x, y)
```

`PixelIsArea`, so the tiepoint names the **corner** of pixel (0,0) and a
half-pixel offset is applied for centres.

| | |
|---|---|
| Validated against | ISRO's own 937,296-node geolocation grid shipped with the product |
| Sample residual (rms) | 0.2846 px |
| Line residual (rms) | 0.4550 px |
| Corner residual | **13.2 mm** |
| Peak scale distortion over the frame | 0.2036 % |

`backend/app/ingestion/sar_geometry.py` is the implementation;
`frontend/src/mission/MissionMap.tsx` carries a direct port of the inverse, so
the cursor readout and the backend agree by construction. This replaced a flat
`30.37 km/°` approximation that was wrong by ~25× in longitude at −87.7° and
~570× at −89.9°.

## 3 · Elevation

LOLA `LDEM_80S_80M` V2.0 (`LRO-L-LOLA-4-GDR-V1.0`), 80 m native posts, bilinearly
resampled onto this frame's 25 m grid.

- The PDS label is parsed as plain text and **units are parsed out of the angle
  brackets**: `MAP_SCALE = 80 <m/pix>` versus `0.080 <KM/PIXEL>` is a 1000× trap
  that produces entirely plausible floats. The parser raises when the unit is
  absent rather than assuming metres.
- `SCALING_FACTOR = 0.5`, `OFFSET = 1737400.0`, `SAMPLE_TYPE = LSB_INTEGER`,
  `SAMPLE_BITS = 16`. Height = DN × 0.5; radius = height + OFFSET.
- Read via `np.memmap`, never `imread` — the 20 m product is 1.85 GB and the
  80 m product 116 MB.
- `assert_dem_is_lola()` re-measures, on **every** run, that the file the
  pipeline reads is bit-identical to the LOLA crop, at tolerance **0.0 m**. It is
  a hard failure, not a warning, because the file is still named
  `dem_native_synthetic.tif` for historical reasons and that name must never
  quietly become true again.

**Resolution honesty.** Slope, roughness and hazard are 80 m-post quantities
carried on a 25 m grid. They contain no relief finer than 80 m, and every
terrain value emitted names 80 in its own note — the number a reader needs in
order to judge them is 80, not 25.

## 4 · Masks, and what "measured" means

| Mask | Source | Pixels | Area | Fraction |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Frame | the full raster | 14,943,444 | 9,339.65 km² | 100 % |
| ISRO pointed swath | the product's own `sri_ma` | 5,324,544 | 3,327.84 km² | 35.63 % |
| Amplitude returned | `valid_native.tif` | 2,337,086 | 1,460.68 km² | 15.64 % |

Amplitude / pointed = **43.89 %**. The remaining 56.11 % of the pointed swath
returned literal integer zero: the beam was aimed there and nothing came back.

**Every `MEASURED` radar statistic in this project is taken over the amplitude
mask only.** The request path used to average over the whole frame — 84 %
never-observed padding — which moved the CPR mean by 5.5× and destroyed the DOP
median outright. Nothing is resampled and nothing is averaged across the void.
